# By default, this theme displays dates with a format like "02 Jan, 2006", but
# you can customize it by setting the `dateFormat` param in your site's config
# file. See [Hugo's Format function docs](https://gohugo.io/functions/format/)
# for details. An example TOML config that uses [ISO
# 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:
# dateFormat = "2006-01-02"
